                On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an automotive term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting
                capability. OBD systems give the vehicle
                owner or repair technician access to the status of the various vehicle sub-systems. The amount of
                diagnostic
                information available via OBD has
                varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early
                versions of OBD would simply illuminate a
                malfunction indicator light or "idiot light" if a problem was detected but would not provide any
                information
                as to the nature of the problem.
                Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in
                addition to a standardized series of
                diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow a person to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions
                within
                the vehicle.

        <div class="panel">
            <p> OBD-II provides access to data from the engine control unit (ECU) and offers a valuable source of
                information when troubleshooting problems inside a vehicle. The SAE J1979 standard defines a method for
                requesting various diagnostic data and a list of standard parameters that might be available from the
                ECU.
                Manufacturers are not required to implement all PIDs listed in J1979 and they are allowed to include
                proprietary PIDs that are not listed. The PID request and data retrieval system gives access to real
                time
                performance data as well as flagged DTCs. Individual manufacturers often enhance the OBD-II code set
                with
                additional proprietary DTCs.</p>

                <li>Mode $01 is used to identify what powertrain information is available to the scan tool.</li>
                <li>Mode $02 displays Freeze Frame data.[19]</li>
                <li>Mode $03 lists the emission-related "confirmed" diagnostic trouble codes stored. It displays exact
                    numeric, 4 digit codes identifying the faults.</li>
                <li>Mode $04 is used to clear emission-related diagnostic information. This includes clearing the stored
                    pending/confirmed DTCs and Freeze Frame data.</li>
                <li>Mode $05 displays the oxygen sensor monitor screen and the test results gathered about the oxygen
                    sensor. There are ten numbers available for diagnostics:</li>
                <li>Mode $06 is a Request for On-Board Monitoring Test Results for Continuously and Non-Continuously
                    Monitored System. There are typically a minimum value, a maximum value, and a current value for each
                    non-continuous monitor.</li>
                <li>Mode $07 is a Request for emission-related diagnostic trouble codes detected during current or last
                    completed driving cycle. It enables the external test equipment to obtain "pending" diagnostic
                    trouble
                    codes detected during current or last completed driving cycle for emission-related
                    components/systems.
                    This is used by service technicians after a vehicle repair, and after clearing diagnostic
                    information to
                    see test results after a single driving cycle to determine if the repair has fixed the problem.</li>
                <li>Mode $08 could enable the off-board test device to control the operation of an on-board system,
                    test, or
                    component.</li>
                <li>Mode $09 is used to retrieve vehicle information.</li>
                <li>Mode $0A lists emission-related "permanent" diagnostic trouble codes stored. As per CARB, any
                    diagnostic
                    trouble codes that is commanding MIL on and stored into non-volatile memory shall be logged as a
                    permanent fault code.</li>
